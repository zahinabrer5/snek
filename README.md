## What is this?
A fun snake game!

This game was originally created for a highschool ICS class.

Tested on Brave Browser & Google Chrome, both running Chromium version 102. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to work entirely on Firefox.


## Playing locally
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Best played on a local server (like the Visual Studio Code's 'Live Server' extension)
    - You'll most-likely get a CORS error if you don't play it on a local server and open the `index.html` file directly on a browser
